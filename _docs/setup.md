Before you arrive, we'd like you to take a few minutes to setup your laptops for the course.
[You can find setup instructions here](https://neurohackademy.org/setup/).

Additionally, [please download this publicly available dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000007/versions/00001), as we'll be using it as a worked example in the first week.

If you haven't already done so, please join [the Slack workspace](mtlbrainhacks-pbv3424.slack.com).
If you need an invitation, please contact [Elizabeth DuPre](mailto:elizabeth.dupre@mail.mcgill.ca).
